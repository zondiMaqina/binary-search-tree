A Data Structure Project from the "Odin Project" curriculum
This data structure is in support with the binary search where deleting or searching will take less than O(n) time

## CLasses Involded
- Node class
- Tree class
- MergeSort class

## Algorithms Involved
- *MERGE SORT*
- *BINSARY SEARCH*
- *BREADTH FIRST SEARCH*

### **DEPTH FIRST SEARCH**
1. iN-ORDER SEARCH
2. PRE-ORDER SEARCH
3. POST-ORDER SEARCH

- All three searching algortihms revolve around the position of **root** node
